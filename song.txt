Apple trees and pear trees went into blooming,
River mists began a floating flow,
She came out and went ashore, Katyusha!
On the lofty bank, on the steeply shore.
 
She came out and sang she song about
Her young friend,
All about the one she dearly loved,
The one whose letters she treasured and kept.
